# Mac Development Ansible Playbook

This set of playbooks is roughly based on [MWGriffin/ansible-playbooks](https://github.com/MWGriffin/ansible-playbooks), and installs and configures all the software I use on my Mac for web and software development, as well as my preferred settings for OS X. Some things in OS X are difficult to get scripted (notably, the Mac App Store in general), so I still have some manual installation steps, but at least it's all documented here.

This is a work in progress, and is mostly a means for me to document my current Mac's setup. I'll be adding settings and packages to this set of playbooks over time.

**Caveat**: This set of playbooks is not meant to be an example of Ansible best practices. I just want to wrap my Mac's configuration in Ansible so I can quickly install all the available development tools I use and need for my development purposes.

*See also*: [Battleschool](http://spencer.gibb.us/blog/2014/02/03/introducing-battleschool), which looks like it's aiming to be a more general solution than what I've built here. (It may be a better option if you don't want to fork this repo and hack it for your own workstation...).

## Installation

  1. Clone this repository somewhere on your local drive.
  2. [Install Ansible](https://devopsu.com/guides/ansible-mac-osx.html).
  3. Run `ansible-playbook main.yml -i localhost, --ask-sudo-pass`.

## Included Applications / Configuration

The following applications are automagically installed as part of this set of playbooks:

  - Adium
  - Google Chrome
  - Cornerstone SVN
  - Dropbox
  - Firefox
  - Handbrake
  - Homebrew
  - Knock
  - nvALT
  - PCKeyboardHack
  - Sequel Pro (MySQL client)
  - Skype
  - Sublime Text
  - Tower (Git client)
  - Transmit (S/FTP client)
  - Vagrant
  - VirtualBox
  - VLC

Jeff Geerling's [dotfiles](https://github.com/geerlingguy/dotfiles) are also installed into the current user's home directory, including the `.osx` dotfile, which is then run to configure Mac OS X, the Finder, Terminal, Mail, and other apps according to the settings inside.

Finally, there are a few other preferences and settings added on for various apps and services.

## Future additions

### Things that still need to be done manually

It's my hope that I can get the rest of these things wrapped up into Ansible playbooks soon, but for now, these steps need to be completed manually (assuming you already have Xcode and Ansible installed, and have run this playbook).

  1. Install JJG-Term.terminal theme (double-click to install).
  2. Install [Sublime Package Manager](http://sublime.wbond.net/installation).
  3. Install all the Mac App Store Apps (see below).
  4. Install all the apps that aren't yet in this setup (see below).
  5. Remap Caps Lock to Escape (keycode 53), using PCKeyboardHack.
  6. Set trackpad tracking rate.
  7. Set mouse tracking rate.
  8. Setting up iCloud (this was presumably done already during system setup, anyways).
  9. Configuring extra Mail and/or Calendar accounts.

### Applications/packages to be added:

These are mostly direct download links, some are more difficult to install because of custom installers or other nonstandard install quirks:

  - [MacVim](https://github.com/b4winckler/macvim/releases/download/snapshot-72/MacVim-snapshot-72-Mavericks.tbz)
  - [iShowU HD](http://downloads.shinywhitebox.com/iShowU_HD_Pro_2.3.7.dmg)
  - [MenuMeters](http://www.ragingmenace.com/software/menumeters/)
  - [TextMate 2](https://api.textmate.org/downloads/release)
  - [TimeMachineEditor](http://timesoftware.free.fr/timemachineeditor/TimeMachineEditor.zip)
  - [CloudyTabs](https://github.com/josh-/CloudyTabs)
  - `ssh-copy-id` (via Homebrew)
  - `pv` (via Homebrew)
  - `mysql` (via Homebrew)
  - `brew cask` (via Homebrew - `phinze/cask/brew-cask`)
    - (Consider using for most if not all of the app installations)
  - more to come...

### Configuration to be added:

  - I have vim configuration in the repo, but I still need to add the actual installation:
    ```
    mkdir -p ~/.vim/autoload
    mkdir -p ~/.vim/bundle
    cd ~/.vim/autoload
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tpope/vim-pathogen/master/autoload/pathogen.vim > pathogen.vim
    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree.git
    ```

### Apps only available via the App Store

I also use the following apps at least once or twice per week, but unfortunately, as the Mac App Store is not able to be controlled via CLI, or any other way I can find (so far), I have to manually install all of these apps from within the App Store application.

  - Tweetbot
  - RadarScope
  - Pixelmator
  - Skitch
  - Quick Resizer
  - Knock
  - 1Password
  - DaisyDisk
  - Byword
  - Aperture
  - Pages
  - Keynote
  - Numbers

There are a couple other apps I'm leaving out of the list, like Microsoft Word, because I normally don't install them unless I need them; unfortunately, about once a year, I get a document that's so old/strange that I need Word or Powerpoint to open the file. I wish people didn't use document layout and slide presentation applications to send me basic textual information :-/

## Ansible for DevOps

If Ansible piques your interest, please check out the book I'm working on, [Ansible for DevOps](https://leanpub.com/ansible-for-devops), where I actually *do* follow Ansible best practices, and will teach you how to do some other amazing things with Ansible.
